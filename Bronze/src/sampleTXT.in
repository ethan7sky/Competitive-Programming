The first line of the 
input contains integers 
N, M, D, and S.

The next D lines (1≤D≤1000)
each contain three integers
p,m,t, indicating that 
person p drank milk m at 
time t. The value of p is 
in the range 1…N, m is in 
the range 1…M, and t is in
the range 1…100. A person
may drink the same milk 
several times, and may 
also drink several types 
of milk at the same point 
in time.

The next S lines (1≤S≤N) 
each contain two integers 
p,t, indicating that 
person p gets sick at time 
t. The value of p is in 
the range 1…N, and t is 
in the range 1…100. Each 
person gets sick at most 
once, and they only get 
sick because they drank 
the bad milk at some 
strictly earlier point in 
time.
